Write a command line utility in Go which takes as arguments a list of directories. The program should output the sizes of each of the individual directories passed as well as a cumulative total. If a --recursive flag is provided, output the sizes of each of the individual directories passed and sub-directories recursively as well as a cumulative total. If a "--human" flag is passed, format the sizes to be human friendly by outputting the size in the most appropriate unit of bytes. For example, 304K for 304,000 bytes and 300M for 300000000 bytes.
